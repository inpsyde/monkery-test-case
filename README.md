# Monkery test case

Composes all relevant packages for WP components unit testing ([brain/monkey](https://brain-wp.github.io/BrainMonkey/) and mockery) and provides test cases for PHPUnit that bootstrap Mockery and BrainMonkey.

Usage:
```
$ composer require --dev [--prefer-dist] inpsyde/monkery-test-case 
```

As of version 2.1.0 (not released yet), you should use the file `inc/bootstrap.php` as your testing bootstrapping file or at least require it within your testing bootstraping file. It loads `antecedent/patchwork` before the composer autoloader:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit
	bootstrap="vendor/inpsyde/monkery-test-case/inc/bootstrap.php"
>
	<!-- â€¦ -->
</phpunit>

```
Now you can use the test cases as usual:

```php
<?php

use MonkeryTestCase\BrainMonkeyWpTestCase;
	
class MyTest extends BrainMonkeyWpTestCase {

	public function test_anything() {
	
		// use \Mockery and \Brain\Monkey here
	}
}
```
